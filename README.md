#LEARNLIST README

##Overview

Learnlist is an application that allows you to store all of your
online learning resources in one place.  Its design is based off
music listening apps with customized, user-created playlists, except
its focus is on learning and finding the best resources out there.

##Technologies

* Ruby, using a Rails framework
* bcrypt gem for password protection
* Postgresql for running a database
* ActiveRecord for database manipulation
* JavaScript & jQuery for front-end interaction
* HTML/CSS & ERB
* Balsamiq for wireframing
